ML-with-Kaggle
==============

ipython notebooks that demonstrate concepts from the Stanford machine learning course in Kaggle competitions.


This directory contains a bunch of ipython notebooks (.ipynb). Each notebook demonstrates an application of lessons from the Stanford Machine Learning course
using data from open kaggle competitions.

The ipython notebooks are named according to the lesson that they demonstrate.
E.g. "Linear Regression - DC Bicycle Share.ipynb" demonstrates the application of linear regression to predicting ridership in the DC Bicycle Share..

The particular kaggle dataset selected for each notebook depends on what the dataset has to offer and the lesson being demonstrated.
