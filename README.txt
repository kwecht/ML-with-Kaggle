This directory contains a bunch of ipython notebooks (.ipynb).

Each demonstrates an application of lessons from the Stanford Machine Learning course
using data from open kaggle competitions.

The ipython notebooks are named according to the lesson that they demonstrate.
E.g. "Linear_regression.ipynb" demonstrates the application of linear regression
to one of the kaggle datasets.

Which kaggle dataset is selected for each notebook depends on what the dataset
has to offer.
